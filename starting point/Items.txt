pb,42,polybius-square, used on floor 3 puzzle., A Polybius square is an arrangement of letters, on a two dimensional coordinate grid., Using the English alphabet only a 5x5 grid is, needed as I and J are combined into a single letter., Plaintext letters are substituted with, their Polybius square coordinates (row; column) to form the ciphertext., In this case the polybius square will only be used, for decrypting messages. Upon entering the command, ‘use polybius-square’ the user should be prompted for a string, of space delimited two-digit numbers, assuming that each digit is, between 1 and 5 (e.g. 13 11 44 for cat).
pb,62,tabula-recta,This is used on floor 5., A tabula recta (Latin for table rule) can be used to encrypt and decrypt (in this case decrypt only), text from the Vigenère cipher without using mathematical calculations., Upon entering the command ‘use tabula-recta’ the user should be prompted for a ‘key’ and a ‘ciphertext’., The program will then output the plaintext.
pb,72,matrix-calculator,This is used on floor 6., Can be used to multiply a 2x2 matrix by a 2x1 vector (mod 26)., It is limited to the 2x2 case to make the implementation easier., Upon entering the command ‘use matrix-calculator’ the user should be prompted for a, 2x2 integer matrix and a 2x1 integer vector., The cipher will then output the product of the matrix and the vector mod 26., For the calculation, ,[ a  b ]    [ e ]    [ ae + bf ], [ c  d ] x [ f ] = [ ce + df ]  (mod 26)
